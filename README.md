# Sonar
## A Fast and Easy Port Scanner

**What is 'Sonar'?**
- Sonar is a free and fast way of scanning the ports of an internet connection.
- It will test all of the desired ports and output whether they are open or closed.

**Things to know before using?**
- Sonar won't work correctly without being connected to the internet.
- Sonar's speed is heavily reliant on your internet connection.
- Requires .NET Framework 4.7 or superior to work!

**How does it work?**
- Input the IP you want to scan, then both the starting and ending ports.
- Tweak the amount of simultaneous threads you want to use during the scan.
- Tweak the amount of MS you want to use as timeout per port.
- Press the 'Scan' button to allow the application to start working.
- Wait until the process finishes all the tasks.
- Each of the ports that are open will be output inside the "Open Ports" list.
